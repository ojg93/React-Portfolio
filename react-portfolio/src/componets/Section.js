                  <p>
                  I am a 27 year old full stax student currently enrolled at Georgia Tech. During the beginning of COVID, I took free online
                  classes on software development and decided to further my education my enrolling into a bootcamp.
                  Outside of coding I enjoy sports, fitness, and music. My favorite hobbies are playing video games and making music of my own.
                  I enjoy coding and learning and want to advance myself into a new carrer. I know the road will be hard but im excited and willing
                  to put the work in and see where my journey takes me!
